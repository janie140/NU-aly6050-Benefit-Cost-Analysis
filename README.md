Benefit-Cost Analysis of Construction Projects

Introduction

Blue Sky Corporation is currently assessing two green energy projects: a wind project in northern Maine and a solar project in Southern Indiana. Benefits considered include customer base expansion, power generation, carbon offsets, job creation, green energy incentives, and commercial development. For each benefit, minimum, most likely, and maximum estimates are available. Capital costs, annualized over 30 years, and annual operations and maintenance costs are also factors.

Corporations rely on benefit-cost analysis to evaluate and select projects. The benefit-cost ratio, derived by comparing total benefits to total costs, helps prioritize projects. A ratio above 1.0 indicates benefits outweigh costs, with higher ratios favoring project selection. In the following sections, we will examine the benefit and cost estimations for both projects, facilitating a comprehensive comparison.
